But you can reduce your overall stress when you think about what you’re doing well and speak kindly to yourself. \n\n1️⃣ The first step for practising self-talk is to notice when a negative thought comes.\n2️⃣Then, ask yourself: How can I change this thought into something kind or caring? You can: \n😃 Look for small parenting accomplishments or efforts. \n✅ Consider what you’ve learned from the negative situation. \n📝Come up with a few ways to help you act differently next time. Remember, this is temporary, and you have the chance to be better in the future."

I yelled at my teen for an honest mistake.\"\n**Positive Self-Talk:** \"Today was tough because I've been overwhelmed. I yelled at my teen, knowing it was an honest mistake. Next time, I'll pause before responding, ensuring I'm calm and in control.\"\n💡 See how the positive self-talk is more supportive? 🏠 Now, your turn! Share a time you talked negatively to yourself, and let’s find and turn it into positive self-talk. Try doing this three times by the week’s end and feel the difference! \nHow parents talk to themselves teaches their kids how to talk to themselves. Girls, boys,  and teens learn from watching their parents.",
